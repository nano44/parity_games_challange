# Results ledger: only checked results
Each entry: label (formalized | refereed-only), statement, commit SHA, referee reports, CHECKER report.
Nothing enters here without passing the gauntlet (TARGET.md section 5).

## Results
(none)

## Dead ends (kept; each with the exact obstruction or counterexample and the instance that killed it)
- DE1 (2026-10-14): arXiv 2511.03752 v1 (van der Heijden), claimed O(n²(n+m)) algorithm. BROKEN: wrong regions on 4-vertex games
  CE1 (l-comp 19b5ce2, experiments/m2/counterexamples/ce1_4v.pg) and cex1 (referee 936d47c, docs/referee/scratch/cex1-*.pg).
  Obstruction: Theorem 1/2 (A(G,d) is a dominion) is false; U^k refinement removes only vertices where the opponent can force A'.
  Details: docs/decisions/M2-arxiv-2511.03752.md.
- DE2 (2026-10-14): L-STRUCT target T1, w^X(n,d) ≥ s^X(n,d−2) for deterministic weak separators (docs/struct/S2-lower-bound-statement.md).
  REFUTED at n=2, d=10 in E, S, V: a 4-state weak (2,10)-separator (l-comp 3e44d2c, experiments/sat-hard/results/weak_E_n2_d10_k4.json)
  while s(2,8) = 5 (strong k=4 UNSAT, LRAT-verified, two solvers). Checked by REFEREE with independent tools (referee 92846bf).
  Obstruction: strong separators grow as s(2,2h) = h+1, weak ones stay at 4 for d = 8, 10. (Not algorithmic: 2-vertex games have d ≤ 3.)
